    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    
    <h3>üîçWere blocked on a simple problem</h3><br><br>
    
    <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I was writing a <code>capitalize</code> function that should return a string with the first letter of each word in uppercase.
        I used <code>.map()</code> and <code>.toUpperCase()</code> to convert all the letters, and joined them back together using <code>.join('')</code>, but I forgot to add a space ' ' between the words.
        So my test kept failing because the words were all stuck together.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I read the error message carefully and compared the expected result to my output.
        I used <code>console.log()</code> to check what my function was returning.
        Then I read the test file more closely and realized that the expected output had spaces between words.
        After that, I checked my <code>.join()</code> method and changed <code>.join('')</code> to <code>.join(' ')</code>.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>At first, I felt frustrated because it seemed like such a small issue, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong.
        Once I found the missing space, I felt relieved and proud that I solved it by carefully checking each step.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I learned that even small details, like spaces in strings, can make a big difference.
        I also learned the importance of reading test messages and checking the expected output closely.</p><br><br>
    
    <h3>üîçElegnatly solved a problem</h3><br><br>
    <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I had to write a function that removes all the odd numbers from an array and returns only the even numbers.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I first tried using a <code>for</code> loop, but then I remembered the <code>.filter()</code> method in JavaScript. 
       I used <code>array.filter()</code> to check if each number was even by using the condition <code>num % 2 === 0</code>. 
       It worked perfectly and made the code much shorter and cleaner.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I felt confident and excited. It was a nice moment because I realized I was starting to think like a developer‚Äîchoosing the right tool for the job.</p><br><br>
    <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p><br><br>
    <p>I learned that using built-in methods like <code>.filter()</code> not only makes the code shorter, but also easier to read and maintain. 
       It's worth taking a moment to think if there's a smarter way to write something.</p><br><br>

    <h3>üîçReflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3><br><br>
    <p>I'm not completely confident with all of the techniques yet, but I can feel myself improving as I face more problems and try different solutions.
       Here's how I feel about each technique right now:
    </p><br><br>
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Very helpful! It helps me slow down and plan before coding.</li>
     <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> I often experiment when stuck. It's not always the best answer, but it helps me learn.</li>
     <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> Still a bit awkward, but explaining out loud really helps clarify my thoughts.</li>
     <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> I used to ignore them, but now I try to read them carefully ‚Äî they often show exactly what's wrong.</li>
     <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> One of the most useful tools! I use it often to check my code step by step.</li>
     <li><strong>Googling:</strong> I do this every day. Searching specific questions helps me understand how others solved similar problems.</li>
     <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> I still feel a bit shy sometimes, but I know it's okay to ask.</li>
     <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I feel more comfortable now asking questions when I'm really stuck.</li>
     <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong> I'm learning to look back and see what worked and what didn't. It helps a lot!</li>
    </ul><br><br>

    <h3>üîçReflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h3><br><br>
    <p>There was a time when I was stuck on a small bug in my code, but I spent hours trying to fix it on my own. 
       I didn't want to ask for help because I felt embarrassed ‚Äî I thought the question might be too simple or silly. 
       In the end, it turned out to be a tiny mistake that someone else spotted in seconds.<br>
       Next time, I'll try to ask for help earlier, especially after I've already tried a few solutions myself. 
       I'm learning that asking questions is part of the learning process and not something to be ashamed of.</p>
