    <h2>My Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h2>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
        My long term goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can work across different areas of software development.<br>
        I'm not focused only on front-end or back-end -- I want to explore both and find what suits me best as I grow.<br>
        I hope to work in a supportive team where I can keep learning, contribute meaningfully, and gain real-world experience.<br>
        Eventually, I'd like to be part of projects that solve real problems and have a positive impact on people's lives.<br>
        I'm also open to teaching or mentoring in the future, so I can support others starting their own coding journey.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for?<br>
        What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>
    <p>
        I want to use the skills I gain at Dev Academy to start a new career in tech -- one that's more stable, creative, and meaningful to me.<br>
        I've worked in hospitality for years, and I know how important it is to work hard and connect with people.<br>
        Now I want to build something with those same values, but in a different way -- through code.<br>
        I don't have one fixed destination yet, but I'm open to exploring different roles and growing my skills step by step.<br>
        Eventually, I want to be someone who can confidently contribute to a team, solve real-world problems with tech, and maybe even build something of my own one day.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
        One of my biggest strengths is that I'm meticulous and committed--I take time to understand things deeply, and I don't give up easily.<br>
        I've also become more reflective and self-aware through Foundations, which I think will help me handle stress and grow during Bootcamp.<br>
        But I know that my biggest limitation might be working under time pressure.<br>
        Since I tend to learn slowly and carefully, I sometimes need more time than others.<br>
        Another challenge might be expressing myself in English, especially in group discussions.<br>
        But I'm learning to be okay with making mistakes, and I'm trying to be more confident in asking for help when I need it.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
        I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be staying focused and keeping up with the pace of Bootcamp.<br>
        Since I learn more slowly than others, I often feel pressure to catch up or compare myself--which can make it hard to concentrate.<br>
        Working in groups might also be challenging because I'm still building confidence in communicating in English, especially when I'm unsure about something.<br>
        But I'm planning to manage this by being honest about how I'm doing, asking for support early, and reminding myself that learning at my own pace is okay.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What non-technical skills -human skills- would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
        I'd like to improve my confidence when working with others, especially during pair programming or group projects.<br>
        I sometimes hesitate to share my thoughts because I worry my ideas aren't "good enough," especially in English.<br>
        I want to develop better communication skills--both speaking and listening-- so I can collaborate more openly and trust myself more.<br>
        I also want to get better at receiving feedback without taking it personally, and giving helpful feedback to others in a kind and respectful way.<br>
        Most of all, I want to build emotional resilience, so I can stay  calm and focused even when things feel difficult or overwhelming.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
        I hope the Bootcamp team can provide clear communication, regular check-ins, and encouragement--especially during tough weeks.<br>
        I'd really appreciate a learning environment where it's okay to ask questions and admit when I don't understand something.<br>
        Sometimes I just need a bit of reassurance or a small reminder that I'm doing okay, even if I'm behind.<br>
        I also hope the team can create a safe space where different learning styles and paces are respected.<br>
        That kind of support really helps me stay motivated and grounded.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
        I expect myself to stay open--to learning, to challenges, and to support.<br>
        I know there will be hard days, but I want to keep showing up and doing my best, even if that looks different from day to day.<br>
        I want to be honest with myself and others, especially when I need help or feel stuck.<br>
        I'll try to balance working hard with taking care of my mental and physical wellbeing.<br>
        Most of all, I want to remind myself that it's okay not to be perfect--I'm here to learn, and that means being brave enough to make mistakes.
    </p>
  
    <h3>ðŸ’¡How and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h3>
    <p>
        I'll try to ask for help as soon as I feel stuck for more than 20-30 minutes, instead of trying to push through it alone for too long.<br>
        I'll use the group chat, ask my peers, or reach out to facilitators when I need support--especially if I feel confused or overwhelmed.<br>
        I know that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, but a smart and healthy way to learn.<br>
        I'll also keep using journaling and reflection to track what I'm struggling with, so I can be clearer when I ask questions.<br>
        My goal is to speak up earlier, not later--and trust that I don't have to go through it all alone.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸ’¡Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
    <p>
        I will manage my workload by setting clear goals each day and breaking tasks into smaller steps so I don't get overwhelmed.<br>
        I'll create a consistent routine and take regular breaks to protect my focus and mental wellbeing.<br>
        When working with others I'll make sure to communicate clearly, listen actively, and be kind and respectful--even when under pressure.<br>
        I'll be honest with my team and facilitators about how I'm doing, and ask for help when needed rather than bottling things up.<br>
        My commitment is to keep learning in a way that's steady, healthy, and sustainable--not perfect, but human.
