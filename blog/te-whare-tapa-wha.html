    <h2>🏠 Te Whare Tapa Whā - A Māori Model of Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>Te Whare Tapa Whā is a holistic wellbeing model developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984. It uses the image of a wharenui (meeting house) with four walls and a foundation to represent the five key aspects of wellbeing. If one wall is weak or missing, overall wellbeing is affected.</p><br><br>

    <h2>🏋️‍♀️ Taha Tinana - Physical Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>Physical wellbeing is about how your body feels, grows, and functions. It includes exercise, healthy eating, and quality sleep. When your body is well, your mind also feels better.</p><br><br>

    <h2>💭 Taha Hinengaro - Mental & Emotional Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>This refers to your mind, thoughts, emotions, and how you express them. Managing stress, staying active, eating well, and being aware of your feelings all support taha hinengaro.</p><br><br>

    <h2>🌌 Taha Wairua - Spiritual Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>Spiritual wellbeing is about your sense of meaning, purpose, and connection — whether through religion, nature, or inner reflection. It helps you feel grounded and connected to yourself and others.</p><br><br>

    <h2>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Taha Whānau - Family & Social Wellbeing</h2>
    <p>This includes the people who support and care about you — not just family, but friends, coworkers, and community. Feeling connected and supported strengthens your identity and wellbeing.</p><br><br>

    <h2>🌿 Whenua - Land & Roots</h2>
    <p>The land and natural environment are the foundation of all wellbeing. For Māori, whenua is deeply tied to identity. Connecting with nature, even in small ways, supports both physical and mental health.</p><br><br>

    <h2>🙌 Why Te Whare Tapa Whā is used at Dev Academy</h2>
    <p>Dev Academy teaches the whole person, not just technical skills. By using a wellbeing model grounded in Te Ao Māori, the school aligns with the values of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and supports students' holistic growth.</p><br><br>
