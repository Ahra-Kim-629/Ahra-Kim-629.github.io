    <h2>About Me</h2>
  
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Ahra, and I’m currently learning web development at Dev Academy in New Zealand.
      I was born and raised in South Korea, and I’ve always been curious and reflective—but recently, I’ve been feeling a little lost.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For a while, nothing really held my interest. I couldn’t find something that made me feel truly focused or excited. But then I discovered coding, and something clicked. Even though it's hard and sometimes frustrating, it’s the first thing in a long time that has made me feel deeply engaged.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Learning to code gives me something to work toward. I get to focus, build something from scratch, and feel real achievement when something finally works. It’s stressful—but strangely, it’s the kind of stress I like. It feels like growth.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I’m still figuring things out, but I know that learning web development is the kind of challenge I needed. It gives me a sense of purpose, and it opens a new path filled with creative possibilities and new energy.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Thank you for reading a bit about me. I’m excited (and a little nervous) to keep growing—one line of code at a time.
    </p>
