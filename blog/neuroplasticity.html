    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset: Learning with Hope</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Neuroplasticity: There's No Such Thing as Failure in Learning</li>
        <p>The most impressive thing I learned about neuroplasticity is that it gives hope to anyone who is learning. To me, it means that ‚Äúthere's no such thing as failure in learning‚Äù - there's only the process. That mindset alone helps me keep going.<br>
            At first, I felt overwhelmed thinking I had to memorize all the code I was learning. But now, I've shifted my focus. I just repeat and practice, again and again, until it becomes familiar to my body and brain.<br>
            I haven't created a perfect routine yet, but I'm working on something more important:<br>
            Whenever I get distracted, I bring myself back to what I was doing. In the past, losing focus meant giving up. Now, returning to the task itself is becoming a new habit.<br></p>

        <li>Growth Mindset: I'm Still Learning, and That's Enough</li>
        <p>Growth mindset felt very similar to neuroplasticity to me. I used to feel like I was too old to learn something new. When I couldn't keep up with others or felt like I didn't know enough, I blamed my age and wondered if it was too late.<br>
            But this mindset gave me hope. It reminded me that my brain can still grow.<br>
            I realized something powerful while reading this:<br>
            Even though I often feel like I don't know much, when I look back at what I've done so far‚Ä¶ I've come a long way. That feeling - seeing my own growth - gives me a huge boost of motivation.<br>
            My personal mindset these days is: ‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù
            Even if I feel like it's not good enough, or I don't know what I'm doing - I just start. That's what matters.</p>

        <li>How These Ideas Shape My Learning Plan</li>
        <p>The biggest change I've felt is that I now have more belief and hope in myself.<br>
            I didn't completely change my learning strategy, but I did change my priorities.
            Before, I used to spend a lot of time stuck on one problem, worrying that I wasn't understanding it or falling behind.<br>
            Now, I try to keep moving forward.<br>
            I've learned that repetition helps me absorb things naturally over time.
            Even if I don't see it right away, I trust that I'm growing. And that trust helps me keep going.<br></p>
