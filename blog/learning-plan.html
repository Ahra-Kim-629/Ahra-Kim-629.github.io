    <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
  
    <h3>🎯 Long-term goal or career pathway</h3>
    <p>
      My long-term goal is to become a front-end or full-stack web developer. I’m particularly interested in creating user-friendly, accessible websites and applications. I want to work in a role where I can collaborate with others, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful projects. Eventually, I would love to be part of a team that mentors newcomers and helps create a supportive learning environment.
    </p>
  
    <h3>💡 Strengths and limitations in learning</h3>
    <p>
      One of my biggest strengths is that I’m persistent and thorough. I like to take my time to fully understand concepts, and I’m not afraid to go back and review things multiple times. I also enjoy problem-solving and feel a sense of satisfaction when I figure something out on my own. However, this also means I tend to move more slowly than others, which can sometimes make me feel behind. I’m also still building confidence when communicating in English, especially when speaking or writing about technical topics. But I know these limitations are temporary, and I’m actively working to improve.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🧠 Human skills I want to develop</h3>
    <p>
      While I’m focused on technical skills, I also want to improve my communication and collaboration skills. I want to become more comfortable giving and receiving feedback, working in pairs, and managing group dynamics. I also want to become more confident speaking up and sharing my ideas, even when I’m not sure I’m right.
    </p>
  
    <h3>📅 Managing my workload and relationships</h3>
    <p>
      I plan to manage my workload by breaking large tasks into smaller ones and scheduling specific times to work on them. I’ll use tools like a calendar and to-do lists to stay organized. I will also check in regularly with my cohort and Facilitators to make sure I’m on track. When working with others, I will approach group work with patience and a willingness to listen. I believe in clear, respectful communication and will try to be honest about what I can and cannot do.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🌧️ When things get overwhelming</h3>
    <p>
      If I start to feel overwhelmed, I’ll try to take a short break to reset my mind. I’ll remind myself that it's okay to not understand everything right away. I’ll talk to classmates, reach out to my Facilitator, and ask for help instead of trying to do everything alone. I’ve learned that asking for help is not a weakness—it’s a smart strategy for learning and growing.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🙋 Where and how I’ll seek help</h3>
    <p>
      I’ll seek help from my cohort through Discord, pairing sessions, and group study. I’ll also book time with Facilitators if I need more individual support. I’m not afraid to ask questions, and I’ll try to be specific about what I’m struggling with. I’ll also try to give support when I can, since teaching others helps me learn too.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🧑‍🏫 What I expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I hope the Facilitation team will provide clear guidance and feedback, and create an open space where we feel safe to ask questions and make mistakes. I’d like to feel that I can approach them any time, whether for technical questions or emotional support. Encouragement and honest feedback will really help me stay motivated.
    </p>
  
    <h3>⏰ Scheduling information</h3>
    <p>
      I study full-time but may need flexibility on weekends due to personal commitments. I’ll do my best to communicate any schedule issues in advance and catch up if I ever fall behind. I understand that clear communication helps the team and the cohort, so I’ll be proactive in managing my time.
