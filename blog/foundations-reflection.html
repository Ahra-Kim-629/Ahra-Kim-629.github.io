    <h2>Foundation Reflection</h2>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>What are three things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</strong></li><br><br>
        <p>Through the Human Skills learning, I realized that I am more self-critical than I thought.<br>
            I often judged myself harshly when I didn't meet my own expectations, especially during coding challenges.<br>
            I also noticed that my ego sometimes gets in the way of asking for help - I used to feel like I had to figure things out on my own to prove myself.<br>
            Lastly, I learned that I am more empathetic than I assumed.<br>
            When I listened deeply to others in looping exercises, I felt a strong connection and desire to support them, which helped me feel more human in a tech space.</p><br><br><br>

        <li><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></li><br><br>
        <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness are like the foundation of being a good programmer, not just a skilled one.<br>
           My values help guide the kind of projects I want to work on and remind me <span class="italic">why</span> I'm learning to code in the first place.<br>
           Empathy lets me understand the users I'm building for - and also helps me work better with others, especially when pair programming of giving/receiving feedback.<br>
           Self-awareness is what helps me notice when I'm stuck, when I'm frustrated, of when I need a break. It helps me take care of myself so I can keep going in a sustainable way.<br>
           Without these human skills, learning would feel mechanical and disconnected.<br>
           With them, I feel more grounded and connected to others and to my purpose.</p><br><br><br>

        <li><strong>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</strong></li><br><br>
        <p>What surprised me the most was how deeply emotional the learning process can be.<br>
           I didn't expect a coding school to ask me to reflect on my feelings, my mindset, or how I talk to myself - but it actually made a huge difference.<br>
           I was surprised by how much my mood, stress level, and self-talk could affect how I learn.<br>
           I also didn't expect that just listening to someone else (really listening) could feel so powerful.<br>
           It reminded me that tech is about people, not just screens and code.<br>
           Overall, I've come to see that building human skills is just as valuable as building technical ones.</p><br><br><br>

        <li><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</strong></li><br><br>
        <p>The most challenging part for me was being honest with myself - especially when reflecting on things like my mindset, emotions, and reactions.<br>
           Sometimes it was uncomfortable to admit when I was frustrated, unmotivated, or comparing myself to others.<br>
           Writing personal reflections in English also felt hard because I wanted to express deep thoughts, but didn't always have the right words.<br>
           But I learned that just trying, even imperfectly, was powerful.<br>
           The process of slowing down and checking in with myself was challenging - but also healing.</p><br><br><br>

        <li><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web develoment Bootcamp course?</strong></li><br><br>
        <p>Because in the real world, being a great developer isn't just about writing clean code - it's about working with people.<br>
           Projects are built in teams, feedback needs to be shared, and communication can be the difference between success and failure.<br>
           Human Skills help us become better collaborators, better listeners, and more resilient learners.<br>
           Especially in tech, where things change so fast, having a growth mindset and emotional intelligence makes it easier to keep adapting and learning.<br>
           This learning gave me tools not just for coding, but for life - and I can already tell it will help me long after the Bootcamp ends.</p><br><br><br>

        <li><strong>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time?<br>
                    Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></li>
        <p>Honestly, it didn't feel like a waste at all - if anything, I feel like it made my programming journey more meaningful.<br>
           Human Skills gave me the mental tools to deal with stress, self-doubt, and moments when I wanted to give up.<br>
           Without that, I might have burned out or lost confidence.<br>
           It also reminded me that tech is about people. We're building things <span class="italic">for</span> people and <span class="italic">with</span> people, so understanding ourselves and others is essential.<br>
           Of course I want to keep practising coding - but now I can do it with more clarity empathy, and resilience. That's a huge win.</p><br><br><br>
