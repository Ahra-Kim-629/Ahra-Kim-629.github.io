    <h2>My Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
  
    <h3>🧭 A situation where I made an ethical decision</h3>
    <p>
      In a previous workplace, I found out that a coworker was taking credit for ideas that were shared in team discussions. At first, I wasn’t sure what to do. I didn’t want to cause conflict or be seen as a troublemaker. However, I deeply value fairness, honesty, and respect for others. After reflecting for a few days, I decided to bring it up gently with my team lead. I didn’t accuse anyone—I simply asked if there was a way to ensure everyone’s contributions were acknowledged. It was a difficult conversation, but in the end, the team started giving clearer credit in meetings. This experience taught me that standing up for fairness, even in small ways, matters.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🌏 How my culture and the people around me influenced my identity</h3>
    <p>
      I was raised in a culture that highly values harmony, respect for elders, and collective responsibility. These values have shaped how I approach group work, learning, and relationships. In particular, I tend to listen carefully and think before speaking, which comes from the cultural idea of being thoughtful and humble. Since moving to New Zealand, I’ve also been exposed to more open and direct communication styles. At first, it was a challenge, but now I see how valuable it is to express your needs clearly and respectfully. Both cultural perspectives have helped me build a more balanced identity—one that values listening, but also knows when to speak up.

    <h3>💪 My strengths and how they support my learning journey</h3>
    <p>
      One of my biggest strengths is being meticulous. I like to double-check my work and understand things deeply, especially when learning something technical like coding. This means I often take longer than others, but I tend to remember concepts well and avoid careless mistakes. I’m also quite empathetic and patient, which makes it easier for me to work with others. I enjoy supporting people when they’re stuck, and I find that teaching or explaining something actually helps me learn too. These strengths make me feel confident about my ability to work in team environments and grow as a learner.
    </p>
  
    <h3>⚠️ My limitations and how they affect my learning</h3>
    <p>
      I sometimes struggle with confidence—especially when learning in English. Even if I understand a concept, I may hesitate to ask or answer questions because I’m afraid of making mistakes. This can slow down my learning and make me feel behind others. Also, because I like to take my time to fully understand something, I can fall into perfectionism. That’s something I’m actively working on. I’ve learned that it's okay to make small mistakes and that asking questions doesn’t mean I’m not capable—it just means I’m engaged. I’m trying to remind myself that learning is not a race, and that growth takes time.
    </p>
  
    <h3>🤝 Working with others — a challenge I faced</h3>
    <p>
      During a group project in the past, I worked with a team where one member wasn’t participating much. The rest of us were doing most of the work, and it felt unfair. I tried to reach out to that person privately to ask if everything was okay and if they needed help. They mentioned they were overwhelmed and weren’t sure how to contribute. I suggested we break tasks into smaller parts and check in more often. That helped a bit, but I learned that early communication is really important. If I were in that situation again, I would ask everyone to be clear about their strengths and limitations from the beginning, so we could divide tasks more fairly and support each other better from the start.
